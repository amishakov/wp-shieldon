== Description ==

WP Shieldon is based on [Shieldon](https://github.com/terrylinooo/shieldon) library, a PHP library that provides anti-scraping and online session control for your WordPress sites.

When the users or robots are trying to view many your web pages at a short period of time, they will temporarily get banned. To get unbanned by solving Catpcha.

You can visit the plugin author - [Terry L.](https://terryl.in)'s blog, try reloading the pages several times then you will see how this plugin works.
