# Shieldon in WordPress

WP Shieldon is a WordPress security plugin based on [Shieldon](https://github.com/terrylinooo/shieldon) library, a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for PHP.

When users or robots try to view many of your web pages within a short period of time, they will be temporarily banned. They can get unbanned by solving a Captcha.

You can visit the plugin author - [Terry L.](https://terryl.in)'s blog and try reloading the pages several times to see how this plugin works. You can also try Terry's login page to find it protected. For more information about Shieldon, please visit [shieldon.io](https://shieldon.io/en/)

Please note that there are three important things you must understand before using WP Shieldon:

1. WP Shieldon is not for beginners.
2. Turn the `Trusted Bot` component on to allow search engine crawlers such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, and others to smoothly crawl your website.

* PHP version > 7.1.0
* WordPress version > 4.7
